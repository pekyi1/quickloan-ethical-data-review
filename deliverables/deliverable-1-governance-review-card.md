# Deliverable 1 — Governance Review Card (QuickLoan Mobile)

## QuickLoan Governance Review Card

| Section | Issue / Definition | Impact | Suggested Fix / Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Data Quality Risk** | Customer data is incomplete or inconsistently formatted due to uncontrolled data capture from mobile devices and weak validation. | Inaccurate loan scoring decisions, inconsistent approval outcomes, unreliable analytics, and reduced trust in automated decisions. | Implement strict input validation at the mobile app and API gateway; enforce schema validation and standard formatting rules in preprocessing; introduce completeness checks and reject/flag incomplete submissions. |
| **2. Legal & Compliance Risk** | Personal data is collected and stored without explicit user consent, creating high risk of non-compliance with Ghana’s Data Protection Act (Act 843). | Legal penalties, reputational harm, loss of user trust, and unlawful processing of personal information. | Implement consent capture during onboarding and before data ingestion; log consent (timestamp, version, purpose); block processing if consent is missing; provide withdrawal mechanism and honor it across systems. |
| **Data Classification** | **Sensitive** | Collected items include financial/loan data, location, device identifiers/logs, and contact information—high-risk personal data requiring strict protection. | Apply encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access control, least privilege, audit logs, and data minimization; limit sharing with third parties; define retention and deletion policies. |
| **3. Bias & Fairness Risk** | Automated loan decisions may be unfair to certain demographic groups due to biased historical training data and lack of fairness monitoring. | Discriminatory outcomes, ethical violations, loss of trust, and regulatory exposure. | Run fairness audits on a schedule (e.g., weekly/monthly); compare approval rates across demographic segments; add thresholds and alerts for disparity; retrain with balanced data and evaluate fairness metrics before deployment. |
| **Source of Bias** | Historical loan repayment/approval data reflects real-world inequality and under-represents some groups; proxy variables (location/device) can encode socioeconomic bias. | Reinforces past inequities and creates unequal access to credit. | Identify and limit proxy variables; use fairness-aware modeling; validate with representative samples; document changes in a model card and governance log. |
| **4. Storytelling / Reporting Recommendation** | **Approval Rate by Demographic Group** | Makes fairness measurable and visible in automated decisioning. | Enables early detection of disparate impact and supports transparent governance. |
| **Metric to Monitor** | **Demographic Approval Rate Disparity (DARD):** approval rate per group and the disparity ratio between the highest and lowest group approval rates over time. |  |  |
| **Visualization Type** | Grouped bar chart (approval rate by group) + line chart (disparity ratio trend). |  |  |
| **Why It Matters** | It provides continuous evidence of fairness and accountability in automated credit decisions, supporting ethical AI and compliance. |
