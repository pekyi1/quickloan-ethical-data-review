# Deliverable 1 — Governance Review Card (QuickLoan Mobile)

## QuickLoan Governance Review Card

| Section | Issue / Definition | Impact | Suggested Fix / Mitigation |
|--------|-------------------|--------|----------------------------|
| **1. Data Quality Risk** | Customer data is often incomplete or inconsistently formatted due to uncontrolled data capture from mobile devices and lack of validation. | Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate loan scoring, unfair approvals or rejections, and unreliable analytics outputs. | Implement strict input validation at the mobile app and API gateway, enforce standardized data formats during preprocessing, and reject or flag incomplete records before model ingestion. |
| **2. Legal & Compliance Risk** | Personal data is collected and processed without explicit user consent, creating a high risk of non-compliance with Ghana’s Data Protection Act (Act 843). | Exposure to legal penalties, regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust due to unlawful data processing. | Introduce explicit consent capture during user onboarding, log consent with timestamps and purpose, block data processing without consent, and allow users to withdraw consent at any time. |
| **Data Classification** | The data collected by QuickLoan Mobile includes financial details, contact information, GPS location, and device identifiers, which qualify as sensitive personal data. | Sensitive data requires stronger protection controls; improper handling significantly increases the impact of data breaches and misuse. | Classify all collected personal and financial data as **Sensitive**, apply encryption at rest and in transit, enforce role-based access control, and define strict data retention and deletion policies. |
| **3. Bias & Fairness Risk** | The automated loan-scoring model may produce biased decisions due to unbalanced historical training data and the absence of fairness monitoring. | Certain demographic groups may be unfairly disadvantaged, leading to discriminatory lending outcomes and ethical violations. | Perform regular fairness audits, compare approval rates across demographic groups, introduce bias detection thresholds, and retrain the model using balanced and representative datasets. |
| **Source of Bias** | Historical loan approval and repayment data reflects existing socioeconomic inequalities and may contain proxy variables that encode demographic bias. | Bias embedded in training data can be amplified by the ML model, reinforcing unfair lending patterns over time. | Identify and limit proxy variables, document data sources, validate datasets for representativeness, and apply fairness-aware modeling techniques. |
| **4. Storytelling / Reporting Recommendation** | Ethical transparency in automated lending decisions is currently lacking and not measurable by stakeholders. | Without clear reporting, unfair or biased outcomes may go unnoticed, reducing accountability and trust. | Introduce a single, actionable fairness metric that is reviewed regularly and shared with governance and compliance stakeholders. |
| **Metric to Monitor** | **Demographic Approval Rate Disparity (DARD):** Measures loan approval rates per demographic group and the disparity ratio between the highest and lowest approval rates over time. | Enables objective measurement of fairness and highlights potential discrimination trends. | Use the metric as a governance control with defined thresholds that trigger investigation when exceeded. |
| **Visualization Type** | Grouped bar chart showing approval rates by demographic group, combined with a line chart showing disparity ratio trends over time. | Visual trends make disparities easy to interpret and communicate to non-technical stakeholders. | Integrate the visualization into regular governance and compliance reporting dashboards. |
| **Why It Matters** | The metric provides continuous evidence of fairness and accountability in automated credit decisions. | Supports ethical AI practices, regulatory compliance, and responsible use of machine learning in financial services. | Helps QuickLoan demonstrate transparent, fair, and compliant decision-making processes. |
