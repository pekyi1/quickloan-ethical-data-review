# Deliverable 3 — Summary of Review Process

In reviewing the QuickLoan Mobile data pipeline, I applied data lifecycle and data classification principles to systematically identify governance, quality, and ethical risks. Each stage of the lifecycle—collection, transmission, storage, processing, automated decisioning, and analytics—was evaluated to confirm whether data was necessary, lawful, accurate, and protected. The data flow revealed excessive collection at the mobile app layer (e.g., contact lists, GPS, device logs), which violates data minimization and increases privacy risk. A major compliance risk was also identified because personal data moves from the API gateway into the raw data database without explicit consent capture, creating potential non-compliance exposure under Ghana’s Data Protection Act (Act 843). Classifying the dataset as sensitive highlighted the need for stronger technical and governance controls such as role-based access, encryption, retention limits, and controlled sharing.

Data quality concerns were identified through incomplete or inconsistently formatted customer submissions, which can distort model inputs and produce unreliable loan decisions. The automated decision service introduces fairness concerns because the ML model can amplify historical bias embedded in training data and because the current process lacks transparency logging. To address this, the review recommends fairness audits and auditable decision logs that capture model versions and outcomes.

The proposed reporting metric—Demographic Approval Rate Disparity—ensures ethical and transparent governance by continuously measuring approval differences across demographic segments and alerting stakeholders when disparities exceed acceptable thresholds. This converts fairness into an observable, actionable governance control and supports accountability in automated lending.
